# buttplug-hs

A haskell client library for the [Buttplug Sex Toy Control System](https://buttplug.io/). Still under development. Contributions Welcome!

## Todo

Users shouldn't have to

- Think about websockets
- handle decoding of wire format
- handle message types directly
  - (consult python and other client implementations for API ideas)
- think about multiple motors if the device they're using only has one
